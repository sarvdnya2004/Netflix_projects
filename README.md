# 🎬 Netflix Movie Data Analysis – Project 1

Welcome to the first project of my Netflix Data Science Series! This project is a deep dive into Netflix movie data where I explore patterns, trends, and insights to better understand user preferences and content behavior on the platform.

> ✅ **Project Type**: Data Analysis  
> ✅ **Tech Stack**: Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn  
> ✅ **Reference Video**: [Netflix Data Analysis by Swati Ma'am – iNeuron iScale Channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjIWRqqMDaw&list=WL&index=33)

## 📁 Project Overview

This project focuses on the foundational steps of data analysis, setting the stage for more advanced AI/ML work in future Netflix-related projects. Here's what's covered:

### ✅ 1. Data Collection & Cleaning  
- Loaded Netflix dataset (CSV format)  
- Handled missing data and performed necessary cleaning  
- Converted data types and ensured consistency for analysis

### ✅ 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Identified content trends over time  
- Analyzed genre distribution and ratings  
- Discovered patterns in release years, durations, and cast info

### ✅ 3. Visualization  
- Created stunning plots to communicate insights clearly  
- Tools used: `Matplotlib`, `Seaborn`  
- Examples include: Heatmaps, Bar charts, Histograms, Pie charts

## 🚀 What's Next?
This is just the beginning! I am planning to build an entire **Netflix Data Science Series**, which will include:
- 📈 Advanced Analytics Projects
- 🤖 Machine Learning Models
- 🧠 Deep Learning Applications
- 🕵️‍♀️ Recommender Systems
- 🧩 NLP & Sentiment Analysis on reviews/subtitles
- 📡 Real-time data pipelines (later stage)

Stay tuned for **Netflix Project 2: Predictive Modeling** coming soon! 🔮
